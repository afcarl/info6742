If the you&#39;re mainly interested in debates that end in agreement, then political discussions, whether online or in person, will always feel pointless. Plus, it&#39;s still possible to have a productive discussion between two people with similar political leanings: discussions can clarify views, check facts, etc., not just change minds.</p>\\n\\n<p>But other than that, I think you underestimate the number of people online who share your frustrations and are open to discussing more nuanced views. If you seek out moderate spaces like this sub, and lead by example with a reasonable tone, it is absolutely possible, although frustrating, to wade through all the extremist crap and have a good discussion. </p>\\n</div>', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'score_hidden': True, 'name': 't1_d9uv7ue', 'created': 1478840037.0, 'author_flair_text': '1∆', 'created_utc': 1478811237.0, 'ups': 1, 'mod_reports': [], 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None}, {'subreddit_id': 't5_2w2s8', 'banned_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_id': 't3_5c8xdc', 'likes': None, 'replies': {'kind': 'Listing', 'data': {'modhash': '', 'children': ['d9uwsnt'], 'after': None, 'before': None}}, 'user_reports': [], 'saved': False, 'id': 'd9uvled', 'gilded': 0, 'archived': False, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'ralpher313', 'parent_id': 't1_d9uv7ue', 'score': 1, 'approved_by': None, 'controversiality': 0, 'body': \"What I meant by that is that they usually tend to not react to facts and logic (if it doesn't confirm their views) and instead shout people down with insults and buzzwords.

If the you&#39;re mainly interested in debates that end in agreement, then political discussions, whether online or in person, will always feel pointless. Plus, it&#39;s still possible to have a productive discussion between two people with similar political leanings: discussions can clarify views, check facts, etc., not just change minds.</p>\\n\\n<p>But other than that, I think you underestimate the number of people online who share your frustrations and are open to discussing more nuanced views. If you seek out moderate spaces like this sub, and lead by example with a reasonable tone, it is absolutely possible, although frustrating, to wade through all the extremist crap and have a good discussion. </p>\\n</div>', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'score_hidden': True, 'name': 't1_d9uv7ue', 'created': 1478840037.0, 'author_flair_text': '1∆', 'created_utc': 1478811237.0, 'ups': 1, 'mod_reports': [], 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None}\n",
